## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- **No API keys required!** The app uses free Hugging Face Inference API endpoints

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Story_teller
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

**Note**: The app uses free Hugging Face Inference API endpoints that don't require authentication. For production use or higher rate limits, you can optionally add a Hugging Face API key to `.env.local`.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/analyze

Analyzes uploaded content (image and/or text) and returns:

**Request:**
- `image` (File, optional): Image file to analyze
- `text` (string, optional): Text content to analyze

**Response:**
```json
{
  "summary": "AI-generated summary of the content",
  "sentiment": "Positive/Negative/Neutral",
  "keyTopics": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"],
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image**: Click the upload area or drag and drop an image
2. **Add Text**: Enter any text content related to your post
3. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Content" to process the input
4. **View Results**: See the generated summary, sentiment analysis, key topics, and confidence score

## Supported Image Formats

- PNG
- JPG/JPEG  
- GIF
- Maximum file size: 5MB

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` | Hugging Face API key for higher rate limits | No |

**Note**: The application works completely without any API keys using free public inference endpoints.

### Model Configuration

The application uses several AI models that can be configured in `/src/app/api/analyze/route.ts`:

- **Image Captioning**: Change the model in the `imageToText` call
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Modify the sentiment classification model
- **Summarization**: Update the summarization model

## Customization

### Adding New AI Models

1. Install additional model libraries
2. Update the API route in `/src/app/api/analyze/route.ts`
3. Modify the response interface if needed

### Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS. Customize the appearance by:
- Editing `/src/app/globals.css` for global styles
- Modifying component classes in `/src/components/PostAnalyzer.tsx`
- Updating the Tailwind config in `tailwind.config.ts`

## Performance Considerations

- Images are processed client-side before upload
- Large images are automatically resized
- API responses are cached where possible
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Slow Analysis**: The free Hugging Face Inference API may have longer response times during peak usage
2. **Rate Limiting**: Free endpoints have usage limits; add an API key for higher quotas
3. **Model Loading**: First requests to models may take longer as they "warm up"

### Debug Mode

The API returns debug information to help troubleshoot issues. Check the browser console for detailed information about model responses.
